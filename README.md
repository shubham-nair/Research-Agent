# üß† AI-Powered Research Agent  
### Automated Web Search and Summarization using Brave Search API and GPT

A fully autonomous research assistant built with Python that performs real-time information retrieval and summarization using **Brave Search API**, **content parsing**, and **OpenAI's GPT models**. This notebook demonstrates how LLMs can be combined with modern APIs to produce structured, high-quality research summaries with minimal human input.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

1. Accepts a user-defined research topic or query.
2. Uses the **Brave Search API** to fetch relevant and recent web links.
3. Parses full article content using `newspaper3k` and cleans it.
4. Sends content to **OpenAI's GPT model** for summarization.
5. Outputs a structured research report from multiple sources.

## üéØ Why It Matters

This project is designed to simulate how a human might perform a focused web-based literature review ‚Äî but automated using real-time APIs and generative AI.

It demonstrates:
- Practical integration of multiple APIs in a pipeline.
- Applied knowledge of LLMs for real-world tasks.
- Clean, modular Python design inside a single reproducible notebook.
- Efficient handling of unstructured web content.
