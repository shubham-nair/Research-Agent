As emergency departments continually strive to improve patient safety and well-being, the development of artificial intelligence is paving the way for major leaps in emergency triage.\n",
            "Oftentimes, patients come in with trouble articulating their complaints and nurses face the challenge of narrowing it down to a specific chief complaint. Coupled with time restraint and the limited information nurses are presented with, emergency triage is highly variable and can result in inconsistent stratification. With artificial intelligence brought into the picture, machine learning triage models can provide assistive tools for nurses to more accurately and consistently stratify patients.\n",

            "For example, based on a review of 4,596 casualties on the battlefield from 2001 to 2011, 87.3% of all injury- related deaths occurred before triage, and 24.3% of these injuries were estimated to be potentially survivable [2]. In such an MCI situation, it is crucial to quickly identify the states of all trauma patients and determine the priority of treatment to increase the survival rate However, the most obvious solution to minimize the time spent on triage is employing enough medical personnel; a shortage of medical manpower results in a decrease in the survival rate of the wounded.\n",
